						<span class="dropcap">The&nbsp</span> collective record of volcano monitoring around the world is housed in roughly 100 volcano observatories and research institutes around the world, a myriad of data formats. Often, volcano seismic data are stored separately from data of ground deformation, and those of gas emissions and other changes are found in other files. Published, legacy data retrievable with months of library work. <br><br>
						This new database is WOVOdat -a collective record of volcano monitoring, worldwide -brought to you by the WOVO (World Organization of Volcano Observatories) and presently hosted at the Earth Observatory of Singapore. It will have many uses -for crisis response and research. The principal goal of WOVOdat, as contrasted with databases at individual observatories, is to enable rapid comparisons of unrest at various volcanoes, rapid searches for particular patterns of unrest, and other operations on data from many volcanoes and episodes of unrest. To make these searches efficient, we gather mainly processed, reduced, published data.<br><br>
						We invite you to explore our website. A generalized schema and data flow are shown on the <a href="/about/index.php">next</a> page. Detail of formats, the schema and tables are provided under <a href="/doc/index.php">Documentation</a>.<br><br>
						A short <a href="/about/timeline.php">history</a> and timetable for developement are given. WOVOdat is still in the data population stage so it is not yet open for data search and downloads. It is, though, open for data uploads, and we list data set that are already in WOVOdat. We actively solicit relevant data contributions from volcano observatories, other institutions, and individual researchers. Please click <a href="/populate/index.php">Populate</a> to contribute data! The more complete data, the more useful WOVOdat will be<br><br>

						A comparison of RSAM (real-time seismic amplitude measurement)culminating in eruption at three volcanoes. Mount St. Helens (May 1985 dome building), Mount Pinatubo (eruption of June 7, 1991), and Mount Redoubt (eruption of January 1990). (Endo et al., 1996). Data and figures from Endo et al., 1996. Monitoring data of any kind can be viewed and compared, in time or space. All data in WOVOdat will be tagged with contact information for the data owner (e.g. a volcano observatory or individual scientist) should raw data or additional details be required.</span>
